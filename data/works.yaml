  type: website
  description:
    This portfolio, built on the Jamstack. I engineered a smart, plugin-extensible data pipeline that analyzes an author-friendly data file, renders preview images from multiple sources, processes text, and finally builds as a website in the Eleventy static site generator with Node.js. This site is hosted on Vercel and features easy content management through Forestry.io.
